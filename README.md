# PiWings
A shield for connecting an XBee to a Raspberry Pi over the Pi's GPIO UART. The board also includes pads for optional LEDs connected to the RSSI, Assoc and Power LEDs from the XBee.

RPiXBee.brd and RPiXBee.sch are the board layout files that are compatible with Eagle 7.6.0

BOM.csv is an output file from DigiKey.com showing a typical parts list.

e14_Rpi3_RevA.lbr is Element 14's Raspberry Pi 3 library that provides the Raspberry Pi header, hole locations and silkscreen. I removed the Raspberry Pi silkscreen from the library.
